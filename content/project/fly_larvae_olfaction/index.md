title: Internal state dependent olfactory behavior
summary: Animal exhibit distinct behavior that dependent their internal states even for the same sensory input. *Drosophila* larva responds different to odors when starved compared with fed. This internal state dependent oflactory behavior is controled by a topdown feedback to antennal lobe circuit.

Animal exhibit distinct behavior that dependent their internal states even for the same sensory input. *Drosophila* larva responds different to odors when starved. Here, we investigate how food deprivation affects olfactory behavior in Drosophila larvae. We find that certain odors repel well-fed animals but attract food-deprived animals and that feeding state flexibly alters neural processing in the first olfactory center, the antennal lobe. We built a parsimonious Boolean network model that incorporates known connectivity property of the circuit to help elucidate how feedback from higher brain region in fly larvae can control context-dependent odor preference.
