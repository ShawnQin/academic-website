The brain forms association between external stimuli with internal neural population activities during memory acquisition. This population neural activities during memory recall are termed “neural representations”. Conventionally, stable memories and stereotyped behaviors are thought to be associated with stable neuronal representations. However, recent experiments with longitudinal recording in free- behaving animals have showed that neuronal activities in cortical areas that are essential for specific tasks undergo continuous reorganization even after the animals have fully learned their tasks, a phenomenon termed “representational drift”. The prevalence of such drift naturally leads to questions about is origin, dynamics, and implementations.
