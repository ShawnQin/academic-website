Shanshan Qin is a postdoctoral fellow in the Pehlevan group. He is interested in the information processing and organizing principles in the nervous system and the learning algorithms that the brain might use. He received a B.S. degree in Physics in 2012 from Central China Normal University at Wuhan. Then he moved to the Center for Quantitative Biology at Peking University for his PhD study, where he explored various problems at the interface between physics and biology. He did his thesis work with Prof. Tang Chao and Prof. Yuhai Tu and obtained his doctorate at 2019. Shanshan enjoys badminton, swimming, hiking, cooking and Chinese Calligraphy.
