I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard [John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/). I am interested in a broad spectrum of questions in computational and theoretical neuroscience. My research aims to elucidate the principles underlying neural computation and cognition. Specifically, my research addresses questions like: 1) how does the brain efficiently sense and represent external world? 2) How does the brain organize and update memories to support adaptive behavior and life-long learning? 3)How does the brain solve computational problems at the algorithmic level? Answers to these questions will have broad implications, such as shedding light on treating neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. I earned my PhD in condensed matter physics from Peking University. During my PhD, I explored various problems at the interface between physics and biology. I was advised by Dr. [Chao Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OnoMAckAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Yuhai Tu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bpaBVYIAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Center for Quantitative Biology](https://cqb.pku.edu.cn/cqben/). Before that, I studied physics at Central China Normal University at Wuhan. I also enjoy badminton, swimming, hiking, cooking, Chinese calligraphy, watching movies and reading.
