I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Pehlevan group at the Harvard John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences. I am interested in a broad spectrum of questions in computational and theoretical neuroscience. Such as how the interaction of neurons in the brain achieve marvelous computational ability? How does the brain solve various challenging tasks via biologically plausible learning rules? What are the principles governing the wiring of neurons during development that enable the formation of specific neural circuits? I received a B.S. degree in Physics in 2012 from Central China Normal University at Wuhan. I then moved to the Center for Quantitative Biology at Peking University to pursuit  my PhD, where I explored various problems at the interface between physics and biology. I did my thesis work with Prof. Tang Chao and Prof. Yuhai Tu and obtained my doctorate at 2019. I also enjoy badminton, swimming, hiking, cooking and Chinese calligraphy.
