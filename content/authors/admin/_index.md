I am an Associate Research Scientist at the Center for Computational Neuroscience, [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/). Driven by a broad interest in theoretical and computational neuroscience, my research seeks to understand the fundamental principles driving neural computation and cognition.

**Current Research Focus**:
- Sensory processing and representation: How does the brain efficiently perceive and encode the external world?
- Memory organization and update: How does the brain store and dynamically update memories to support adaptive behavior and lifelong learning?
- Algorithmic foundations of computation: What are the underlying algorithms the brain uses to solve complex problems?

**Background**:

Prior to joining Flatiron Institute, I held a postdoctoral fellowship at [Harvard's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) where I worked with [Cengiz Pehlevan](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/people/cengiz-pehlevan). I earned my PhD in condensed matter physics from Peking University where I was advised by [Chao Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OnoMAckAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yuhai Tu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bpaBVYIAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [Center for Quantitative Biology](https://cqb.pku.edu.cn/cqben/). Before that, I pursued my undergraduate studies in physics at Central China Normal University in Wuhan.

I will join the [Institute of Natural Sciences](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a tenure-track Associate Professor starting from January 2025.
