abstract: There are numerous different odorant molecules in nature but only a relatively
  small number of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in brains. This ``compressed sensing''
  challenge is compounded by the constraint that ORNs are nonlinear sensors with a
  finite dynamic range. Here, we investigate possible optimal olfactory coding strategies
  by maximizing mutual information between odor mixtures and ORNs' responses with
  respect to the bipartite odor-receptor interaction network (ORIN) characterized
  by sensitivities between all odorant--ORN pairs. For ORNs without spontaneous (basal)
  activity, we find that the optimal ORIN is sparse---a finite fraction of sensitives
  are zero, and the nonzero sensitivities follow a broad distribution that depends
  on the odor statistics. We show analytically that sparsity in the optimal ORIN originates
  from a trade-off between the broad tuning of ORNs and possible interference. Furthermore,
  we show that the optimal ORIN enhances performances of downstream learning tasks
  (reconstruction and classification). For ORNs with a finite basal activity, we find
  that having inhibitory odor--receptor interactions increases the coding capacity
  and the fraction of inhibitory interactions increases with the ORN basal activity.
  We argue that basal activities in sensory receptors in different organisms are due
  to the trade-off between the increase in coding capacity and the cost of maintaining
  the spontaneous basal activity. Our theoretical findings are consistent with existing
  experiments and predictions are made to further test our theory. The optimal coding
  model provides a unifying framework to understand the peripheral olfactory systems
  across different organisms.
