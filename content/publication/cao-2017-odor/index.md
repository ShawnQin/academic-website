abstract: Inhibitory response occurs throughout the nervous system, including the
  peripheral olfactory system. While odor-evoked excitation in peripheral olfactory
  cells is known to encode odor information, the molecular mechanism and functional
  roles of odor-evoked inhibition remain largely unknown. Here, we examined Drosophila
  olfactory sensory neurons and found that inhibitory odors triggered outward receptor
  currents by reducing the constitutive activities of odorant receptors, inhibiting
  the basal spike firing in olfactory sensory neurons. Remarkably, this odor-evoked
  inhibition of olfactory sensory neurons elicited by itself a full range of olfactory
  behaviors from attraction to avoidance, as did odor-evoked olfactory sensory neuron
  excitation. These results indicated that peripheral inhibition is comparable to
  excitation in encoding sensory signals rather than merely regulating excitation.
  Furthermore, we demonstrated that a bidirectional code with both odor-evoked inhibition
  and excitation in single olfactory sensory neurons increases the odor-coding capacity,
  providing a means of efficient sensory encoding.
