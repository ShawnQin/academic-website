abstract: 'Transcription factors (TFs) can encode the information of upstream signal
  in terms of its temporal activation dynamics. However, it remains unclear how different
  types of TF dynamics are decoded by downstream signalling networks. In this work,
  we studied all three-node transcriptional networks for their ability to distinguish
  two types of TF dynamics: amplitude modulation (AM), where the TF is activated with
  a constant amplitude, and frequency modulation (FM), where the TF activity displays
  an oscillatory behavior. We found two sets of network topologies: one set can differentially
  respond to AM TF signal but not to FM; the other set to FM signal but not to AM.
  Interestingly, there is little overlap between the two sets. We identified the prevalent
  topological features in each set and gave a mechanistic explanation as to why they
  can differentially respond to only one type of TF signal. We also found that some
  network topologies have a weak (not robust) ability to differentially respond to
  both AM and FM input signals by using different values of parameters for AM and
  FM cases. Our results provide a novel network mechanism for decoding different TF
  dynamics.'
