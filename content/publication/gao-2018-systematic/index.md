abstract: Proteins are essential players of life activities. Intracellular protein
  levels directly affect cellular functions and cell fate. Upon cell division, the
  proteins in the mother cell are inherited by the daughters. However, what factors
  and by how much they affect this epigenetic inheritance of protein abundance remains
  unclear. Using both computational and experimental approaches, we systematically
  investigated this problem. We derived an analytical expression for the dependence
  of protein inheritance on various factors and showed that it agreed with numerical
  simulations of protein production and experimental results. Our work provides a
  framework for quantitative studies of protein inheritance and for the potential
  application of protein memory manipulation.
