abstract: The brain displays a remarkable ability to sustain stable memories, allowing
  animals to execute precise behaviors or recall stimulus associations years after
  they were first learned. Yet, recent long-term recording experiments have revealed
  that single-neuron representations continuously change over time, contravening the
  classical assumption that learned features remain static. How do unstable neural
  codes support robust perception, memories, and actions? Here, we review recent experimental
  evidence for such representational drift across brain areas, as well as dissections
  of its functional characteristics and underlying mechanisms. We emphasize theoretical
  proposals for how drift need not only be a form of noise for which the brain must
  compensate. Rather, it can emerge from computationally beneficial mechanisms in
  hierarchical networks performing robust probabilistic computations.
