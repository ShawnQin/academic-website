abstract: Axonal spheroids (dystrophic neurites) are commonly found around amyloid
  deposits in Alzheimertextquoterights disease (AD). They impair electrical conduction,
  disrupt neural circuits, and correlate with AD severity. Despite their significance,
  the mechanisms underlying spheroid formation remain unknown. To address this, we
  developed a proximity labeling proteomics approach to uncover the proteome of spheroids
  in human postmortem and mouse brains. Additionally, we established a human iPSC-derived
  AD model allowing mechanistic investigation of spheroid pathology and optical electrophysiology.
  This approach revealed the subcellular molecular architecture of spheroids and identified
  abnormalities in key biological processes, including protein turnover, cytoskeleton
  dynamics, and lipid transport. Notably, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which regulates
  these processes, was activated within spheroids. Furthermore, phosphorylated mTOR
  levels in spheroids strongly correlated with AD severity in humans. Importantly,
  inhibition of mTOR in iPSC-derived neurons and in mice ameliorated spheroid pathology.
  Altogether, our study provides a multidisciplinary toolkit for investigating mechanisms
  and novel targets for axonal pathology in neurodegeneration.Competing Interest StatementThe
