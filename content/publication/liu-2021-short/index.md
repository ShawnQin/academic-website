abstract: In Drosophila, olfactory information received by olfactory receptor neurons
  (ORNs) is first processed by an incoherent feed forward neural circuit in the antennal
  lobe (AL) that consists of ORNs (input), inhibitory local neurons (LNs), and projection
  neurons (PNs). This ``early'' olfactory information processing has two important
  characteristics. First, response of a PN to its cognate ORN is normalized by the
  overall activity of other ORNs, a phenomenon termed ``divisive normalization.''
  Second, PNs respond strongly to the onset of ORN activities, but they adapt to prolonged
  or continuously varying inputs. Despite the importance of these characteristics
  for learning and memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here,
  we develop a circuit model for describing the ORN-LN-PN dynamics by including key
  neuron-neuron interactions such as short-term plasticity (STP) and presynaptic inhibition
  (PI). By fitting our model to experimental data quantitatively, we show that a strong
  STP balanced between short-term facilitation (STF) and short-term depression (STD)
  is responsible for the observed nonlinear divisive normalization in Drosophila.
  Our circuit model suggests that either STP or PI alone can lead to adaptive response.
  However, by comparing our model results with experimental data, we find that both
  STP and PI work together to achieve a strong and robust adaptive response. Our model
  not only helps reveal the mechanisms underlying two main characteristics of the
  early olfactory process, it can also be used to predict PN responses to arbitrary
  time-dependent signals and to infer microscopic properties of the circuit (such
  as the strengths of STF and STD) from the measured input-output relation. Our circuit
  model may be useful for understanding the role of STP in other sensory systems.
