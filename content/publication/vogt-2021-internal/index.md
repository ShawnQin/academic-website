abstract: The first olfactory processing center in the larval Drosophila brain uses
  information about feeding state to shape behavior. Animals exhibit different behavioral
  responses to the same sensory cue depending on their internal state at a given moment.
  How and where in the brain are sensory inputs combined with state information to
  select an appropriate behavior? Here, we investigate how food deprivation affects
  olfactory behavior in Drosophila larvae. We find that certain odors repel well-fed
  animals but attract food-deprived animals and that feeding state flexibly alters
  neural processing in the first olfactory center, the antennal lobe. Hunger differentially
  modulates two output pathways required for opposing behavioral responses. Upon food
  deprivation, attraction-mediating uniglomerular projection neurons show elevated
  odor-evoked activity, whereas an aversion-mediating multiglomerular projection neuron
  receives odor-evoked inhibition. The switch between these two pathways is regulated
  by the lone serotonergic neuron in the antennal lobe, CSD. Our findings demonstrate
  how flexible behaviors can arise from state-dependent circuit dynamics in an early
  sensory processing center.
