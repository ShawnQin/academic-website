abstract: 'We propose a novel biologically plausible solution to the credit assignment
  problem motivated by observations in the ventral visual pathway and trained deep
  neural networks. In both, representations of objects in the same category become
  progressively more similar, while objects belonging to different categories become
  less similar. We use this observation to motivate a layer-specific learning goal
  in a deep network: each layer aims to learn a representational similarity matrix
  that interpolates between previous and later layers. We formulate this idea using
  a contrastive similarity matching objective function and derive from it deep neural
  networks with feedforward, lateral, and feedback connections and neurons that exhibit
  biologically plausible Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Contrastive similarity
  matching can be interpreted as an energy-based learning algorithm, but with significant
  differences from others in how a contrastive function is constructed.'
