abstract: Many animals perceive odorant molecules by collecting information from ensembles
  of olfactory neurons. Each neuron employs receptors that are tuned to recognize
  certain odorant molecules by chemical binding affinity. Olfactory systems are able,
  in principle, to detect and discriminate diverse odorants by using combinatorial
  coding strategies. Multineuronal imaging with high-throughput stimulus delivery
  allows comprehensive measurement of ensemble-level sensory representations. We have
  used microfluidics and multineuronal imaging to study ensemble-level olfactory representations
  at the sensory periphery of the nematode C. elegans. The collective activity of
  nematode chemosensory neurons reveals high-dimensional representations of olfactory
  information across a broad space of odorant molecules. We reveal diverse tuning
  properties and dose-response curves across chemosensory neurons and across odorants.
  We describe the unique contribution of each sensory neuron to an ensemble-level
  code for volatile odorants. We also show how natural stimuli, a set of nematode
  pheromones, are encoded by the sensory periphery. The integrated activity of the
  C. elegans chemosensory neurons contains sufficient information to robustly encode
  the intensity and identity of diverse chemical stimuli.Competing Interest StatementThe
