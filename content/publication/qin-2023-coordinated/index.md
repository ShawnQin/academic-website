abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that neural population codes in many brain
  areas continuously change even when animals have fully learned and stably perform
  their tasks. This representational `drift'naturally leads to questions about its
  causes, dynamics and functions. Here we explore the hypothesis that neural representations
  optimize a representational objective with a degenerate solution space, and noisy
  synaptic updates drive the network to explore this (near-)optimal space causing
  representational drift. We illustrate this idea and explore its consequences in
  simple, biologically plausible Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network models of representation
  learning. We find that the drifting receptive fields of individual neurons can be
  characterized by a coordinated random walk, with effective diffusion constants depending
  on various parameters such as learning rate, noise amplitude and input statistics.
  Despite such drift, the representational similarity of population codes is stable
  over time. Our model recapitulates experimental observations in the hippocampus
  and posterior parietal cortex and makes testable predictions that can be probed
  in future experiments.
