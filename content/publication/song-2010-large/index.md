abstract: Porous single-crystalline hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanorod array has been synthesized
  on large-area Ti foil via a facile hydrothermal method followed by a simple annealing
  treatment in Ar gas at 450 $,^∘$C. The nanorods attained from 6 h hydrothermal reaction
  are average 30 nm in diameter and 450 nm in length. When used directly as additive-free
  anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the α-Fe2O3 nanorod array demonstrates excellent
  cycling performance up to 50 times (∼562 mAh g−1 retained at C/5) and good rate
  capability, in distinct contrast to α-Fe2O3 nanorod powder-based electrode. The
  improved electrochemical performance could be ascribed to the enhanced electron
  transport and Li+ diffusion that result from the well-defined array architecture
  and the porous nature of the single-crystalline nanorods. Fe3O4 and C/α-Fe2O3 nanorod
  arrays are further prepared to improve the lithium storage property. Our work represents
  a successful example of fabricating iron oxide 1D nanostructure arrays directly
  on nonreactive current collector. Once optimized, the array electrode may hold great
  promise in thin-film LIBs and other microelectronic systems.
