	abstract = {iCasp9 suicide gene has been widely used as a promising killing strategy in various cell therapies. However, different cells show significant heterogeneity in response to apoptosis inducer, posing challenges in clinical applications of killing strategy. The cause of the heterogeneity remains elusive so far. Here, by simultaneously monitoring the dynamics of iCasp9 dimerization, Caspase3 activation, and cell fate in single cells, we found that the heterogeneity was mainly due to cell-to-cell variability in initial iCasp9 expression and XIAP/Caspase3 ratio. Moreover, multiple-round drugging cannot increase the killing efficiency. Instead, it will place selective pressure on protein levels, especially on the level of initial iCasp9, leading to drug resistance. We further show this resistance can be largely eliminated by combinatorial drugging with XIAP inhibitor at the end, but not at the beginning, of the multiple-round treatments. Our results unveil the source of cell fate heterogeneity and drug resistance in iCasp9-mediated cell death, which may enlighten better therapeutic strategies for optimized killing.},

@article{liu2021short,
	abstract = {In Drosophila, olfactory information received by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) is first processed by an incoherent feed forward neural circuit in the antennal lobe (AL) that consists of ORNs (input), inhibitory local neurons (LNs), and projection neurons (PNs). This ``early'' olfactory information processing has two important characteristics. First, response of a PN to its cognate ORN is normalized by the overall activity of other ORNs, a phenomenon termed ``divisive normalization.'' Second, PNs respond strongly to the onset of ORN activities, but they adapt to prolonged or continuously varying inputs. Despite the importance of these characteristics for learning and memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we develop a circuit model for describing the ORN-LN-PN dynamics by including key neuron-neuron interactions such as short-term plasticity (STP) and presynaptic inhibition (PI). By fitting our model to experimental data quantitatively, we show that a strong STP balanced between short-term facilitation (STF) and short-term depression (STD) is responsible for the observed nonlinear divisive normalization in Drosophila. Our circuit model suggests that either STP or PI alone can lead to adaptive response. However, by comparing our model results with experimental data, we find that both STP and PI work together to achieve a strong and robust adaptive response. Our model not only helps reveal the mechanisms underlying two main characteristics of the early olfactory process, it can also be used to predict PN responses to arbitrary time-dependent signals and to infer microscopic properties of the circuit (such as the strengths of STF and STD) from the measured input-output relation. Our circuit model may be useful for understanding the role of STP in other sensory systems.},

@article{lin2022functional,
	abstract = {Many animals perceive odorant molecules by collecting information from ensembles of olfactory neurons. Each neuron employs receptors that are tuned to recognize certain odorant molecules by chemical binding affinity. Olfactory systems are able, in principle, to detect and discriminate diverse odorants by using combinatorial coding strategies. Multineuronal imaging with high-throughput stimulus delivery allows comprehensive measurement of ensemble-level sensory representations. We have used microfluidics and multineuronal imaging to study ensemble-level olfactory representations at the sensory periphery of the nematode C. elegans. The collective activity of nematode chemosensory neurons reveals high-dimensional representations of olfactory information across a broad space of odorant molecules. We reveal diverse tuning properties and dose-response curves across chemosensory neurons and across odorants. We describe the unique contribution of each sensory neuron to an ensemble-level code for volatile odorants. We also show how natural stimuli, a set of nematode pheromones, are encoded by the sensory periphery. The integrated activity of the C. elegans chemosensory neurons contains sufficient information to robustly encode the intensity and identity of diverse chemical stimuli.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

@article{gao2018network,
	abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) can encode the information of upstream signal in terms of its temporal activation dynamics. However, it remains unclear how different types of TF dynamics are decoded by downstream signalling networks. In this work, we studied all three-node transcriptional networks for their ability to distinguish two types of TF dynamics: amplitude modulation (AM), where the TF is activated with a constant amplitude, and frequency modulation (FM), where the TF activity displays an oscillatory behavior. We found two sets of network topologies: one set can differentially respond to AM TF signal but not to FM; the other set to FM signal but not to AM. Interestingly, there is little overlap between the two sets. We identified the prevalent topological features in each set and gave a mechanistic explanation as to why they can differentially respond to only one type of TF signal. We also found that some network topologies have a weak (not robust) ability to differentially respond to both AM and FM input signals by using different values of parameters for AM and FM cases. Our results provide a novel network mechanism for decoding different TF dynamics.},

	abstract = {Inhibitory response occurs throughout the nervous system, including the peripheral olfactory system. While odor-evoked excitation in peripheral olfactory cells is known to encode odor information, the molecular mechanism and functional roles of odor-evoked inhibition remain largely unknown. Here, we examined Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons and found that inhibitory odors triggered outward receptor currents by reducing the constitutive activities of odorant receptors, inhibiting the basal spike firing in olfactory sensory neurons. Remarkably, this odor-evoked inhibition of olfactory sensory neurons elicited by itself a full range of olfactory behaviors from attraction to avoidance, as did odor-evoked olfactory sensory neuron excitation. These results indicated that peripheral inhibition is comparable to excitation in encoding sensory signals rather than merely regulating excitation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a bidirectional code with both odor-evoked inhibition and excitation in single olfactory sensory neurons increases the odor-coding capacity, providing a means of efficient sensory encoding.},

We formulate this idea using a contrastive similarity matching objective function and derive from it deep neural networks with feedforward, lateral, and feedback connections and neurons that exhibit biologically plausible Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity. Contrastive similarity matching can be interpreted as an energy-based learning algorithm, but with significant differences from others in how a contrastive function is constructed.}},

	abstract = {Complex dynamical systems often have tipping points and exhibit catastrophic regime shift. Despite the notorious difficulty of predicting such transitions, accumulating studies have suggested the existence of generic early-warning signals (EWSs) preceding upcoming transitions. However, previous theories and models were based on the effect of the intrinsic noise (IN) when a system is approaching a critical point, and did not consider the pervasive environmental fluctuations or the extrinsic noise (EN). Here, we extend previous theory to investigate how the interplay of EN and IN affects EWSs. Stochastic simulations of model systems subject to both IN and EN have verified our theory and demonstrated that EN can dramatically alter and diminish the EWS. This effect is stronger with increasing amplitude and correlation time scale of the EN. In the presence of EN, the EWS can fail to predict or even give a false alarm of critical transitions.},

@article{qin2019optimal,
	abstract = {There are numerous different odorant molecules in nature but only a relatively small number of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in brains. This ``compressed sensing'' challenge is compounded by the constraint that ORNs are nonlinear sensors with a finite dynamic range. Here, we investigate possible optimal olfactory coding strategies by maximizing mutual information between odor mixtures and ORNs' responses with respect to the bipartite odor-receptor interaction network (ORIN) characterized by sensitivities between all odorant--ORN pairs. For ORNs without spontaneous (basal) activity, we find that the optimal ORIN is sparse---a finite fraction of sensitives are zero, and the nonzero sensitivities follow a broad distribution that depends on the odor statistics. We show analytically that sparsity in the optimal ORIN originates from a trade-off between the broad tuning of ORNs and possible interference. Furthermore, we show that the optimal ORIN enhances performances of downstream learning tasks (reconstruction and classification). For ORNs with a finite basal activity, we find that having inhibitory odor--receptor interactions increases the coding capacity and the fraction of inhibitory interactions increases with the ORN basal activity. We argue that basal activities in sensory receptors in different organisms are due to the trade-off between the increase in coding capacity and the cost of maintaining the spontaneous basal activity. Our theoretical findings are consistent with existing experiments and predictions are made to further test our theory. The optimal coding model provides a unifying framework to understand the peripheral olfactory systems across different organisms.},

This representational `drift'naturally leads to questions about its causes, dynamics and functions. Here we explore the hypothesis that neural representations optimize a representational objective with a degenerate solution space, and noisy synaptic updates drive the network to explore this (near-)optimal space causing representational drift. We illustrate this idea and explore its consequences in simple, biologically plausible Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network models of representation learning. We find that the drifting receptive fields of individual neurons can be characterized by a coordinated random walk, with effective diffusion constants depending on various parameters such as learning rate, noise amplitude and input statistics. Despite such drift, the representational similarity of population codes is stable over time. Our model recapitulates experimental observations in the hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex and makes testable predictions that can be probed in future experiments.},

Yet, recent long-term recording experiments have revealed that single-neuron representations continuously change over time, contravening the classical assumption that learned features remain static. How do unstable neural codes support robust perception, memories, and actions? Here, we review recent experimental evidence for such representational drift across brain areas, as well as dissections of its functional characteristics and underlying mechanisms. We emphasize theoretical proposals for how drift need not only be a form of noise for which the brain must compensate. Rather, it can emerge from computationally beneficial mechanisms in hierarchical networks performing robust probabilistic computations.},
